# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. This project was created with the intention of practicing html, css, git and GitHub usage, and webpage layout/design. It is not a functional webpage and is not associated with a real coffee shop.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Future plans for the project

This project is now undergoing review, afterwhich, I will likely make small adjustments to improve performance. However, aside from small, mostly unnoticeable tweaks, it is completed.  
 I may or may not return to this project at a later time to add personal touches. These may include:

- a fixed navigation bar
- hover effects on iframes
- a new animation feature
